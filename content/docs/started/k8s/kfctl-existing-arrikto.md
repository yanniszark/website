## kfctl_existing_arrikto has a new home

After a lot of requests by the community, we turned the Arrikto config into a community-supported config.
Please use the [kfctl_istio_dex](/docs/started/k8s/kfctl-istio-dex) config,
which is now supported and  developed by all members of the Kubeflow community,
to install Kubeflow with Auth on an existing Kubernetes Cluster.
